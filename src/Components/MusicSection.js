              <p>
                Music is a hobby of mine.  My experience is with singing and music production.
                My goal is to begin to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create original 
                music so that I expand my musical artistic expression.  At some point I would like
                 to expand that further to help others who don't know how to play physical instruments 
                 to learn how to make AI an instrument for music the way it is for graphics and writing.
